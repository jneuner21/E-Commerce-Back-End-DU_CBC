# E-Commerce-Back-End-DU_CBC

    Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit a full-stack web developer. The task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I've configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
